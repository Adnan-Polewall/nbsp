  Directory and File Naming Standards


      for
      FTP Servers *

* This is a working document on an evolving concept. Further change is
to be expected.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*1. Introduction*

Draft Directory and File naming Standards for FTP Servers were first
adopted at a Restricted Session of the CBS Working Group on Data
Management (WGDM) in February, 1995. These standards were intended for
use by FTP servers participating in trial implementations of the CBS
Distributed Databases Concept. Since the standards adopted referred to
an emerging concept, evolution in the standards themselves was expected.
Related software development was therefore suggested to be approached
with caution. Since that time, evolution has occurred, but not in a
coordinated manner.

In a 1997 meeting of the COPC, it was requested that the OFCM WG/CIDE
look into developing standards for directory and file naming standards
for FTP servers used by centers within the US. The subsequent meeting of
the WG/CIDE requested a small group consisting of representatives from
FNMOC, NWSTG, and NCEP undertake such a development. The group reviewed
the experiences of the CBS WGDM effort and found some of the concepts in
the 1995 draft standards were deficient and should be discarded, while
others were useful and should be retained. In the next section, some of
the issues that must be addressed in the standards are discussed. A
proposal for some basic features the standard should contain is
presented in Section 3.

*2.Some Issues for the Standards* /(background)/

_Type of Information_: The first issue is what set of information the
revised standards should contain in the directory and file names. There
is some commonality in the types of information FTP servers now use, for
most contain some of the following kinds of information (referred to as
information elements in this paper) in their directory and file names
(note that this list is not exhaustive):

_Order of Information_: Once the type of information to be contained in
the revised standards is established, the order that information should
appear needs to be decided. For example, should reference date precede
generating process or should generating process precede reference date?
Should level of data precede grid or should reverse be true? Different
centers maintain their servers for different purposes, and the order
this information appears has a significant effect on the ease or
difficulty of retrieving the information contained. A brief review of
some FTP servers suggests that while there is considerable commonality
with respect to the information elements they use, there is no
commonality regarding how these information elements are assembled into
directory and file names. /The group felt that consensus would be
difficult to reach on this point, and the standards must _therefore
permit the center maintaining the server to decide the order of the
information elements._/

_Length of Directory and File Names_: If we adopt the position of using
convenient UNIX constructs to create user-friendly directory and file
names, the issue of how many characters are allowed for the directory
and file names must be addressed. Long file names can be made more user
friendly than short ones. However, different server implementations have
different restrictions. A quite small sample revealed permissible file
name lengths from 14 characters to over a thousand. Lengths of 14
characters leave precious little opportunity to create user-friendly
file names.

_Composition of Information Elements_: A decision to rely more heavily
on alphabetic rather than numeric information elements carries with it
the challenge of reaching agreement on what the alphabetic entrees
should be. This will be particularly challenging when complete
common-usage names must be abbreviated in the interests of compactness.

_Number of Directory Levels_: Different servers may also permit
different numbers of directory levels. Once the type of information to
be contained in the revised standards is established, the number of
directory levels and the number of characters allowed in the directory
and file names could be considered. /However, as no consensus is likely
to exist on this point either, _the revised standards must also allow
the center maintaining the server to decide the number of directory
levels and the lengths of the directory and file names_/.

*3. The Current Evolution of the Directory and File Naming Standards for
FTP Servers*

In light of the past experience, the group felt revised standards should
incorporate several basic features. //

/ First/, the individual information elements that comprise the
standards must be nationally coordinated with respect to their form and
content.

/ Second/, except for insisting the server location be the first
directory level, the centers responsible for the servers should be
allowed to assemble these information elements into directory and file
names as needed.

/ Third/, use should be made of alphabetic or alphanumeric entrees
whenever possible.

/Fourth/, the individual information elements should be of limited but
fixed length.

/Fifth/, the allowable character set should be restricted to A-Z, a-z,
0-9, period (.), underscore (_), and hyphen (-).

/Sixth/, an allowable "*.* character string" at the *file name level
only* as an extension to the file for potential processing by standard
commercial software applications. The normal extensions expected to be
used are "*.*bin", "*.*txt", "*.*pdf", "*.*html", "*.*xml", "*.*gif",
"*.*jpg", "*.*xls", "*.*doc", etc as they become commonly available
within the industry. They will not have "element IDs" as defined within
this standard.

One method of allowing centers to assemble the information elements as
they wish, yet ensure the information elements can always be uniquely
identified, is to first consider each information element to consist of
an *element ID* - made up of two letters followed by a period - and
element information. This would ensure unique identification of which
information element(s) each directory and file name entry consists of
yet allow the needed flexibility. Second, each directory and file name
should be allowed to consist of several information elements connected
by an underscore. Finally, use of the dash should be reserved for
indicating that the information element is a spatial or temporal
interval. The following description of the individual elements adheres
to these basic principles and represents the current evolution of our
efforts:

_*ELEMENT NAME*_ _*ELEMENT ID*_

{SL <#sl>|sl}.ccnnnsss ==> server location

============================== ROOT ===================================

{AR <#ar>|ar}.a...a ==> area of data

{BC <#bc>|bc}.x ==> bufr collectives

{BS <#bs>|bs}.aaaaa ==> bufr stations

{CU <#cu>|cu} lllll ==>customer

{CS <#cs>|cs} aaaa ==>center supplier

{CY <#cy>|cy}.hh ==> cycle of run

{DC <#dc>|dc}.ccc(ccc) ==> data category

{DD <#dd>|dd}.yyyymmdd ==> data date

{DF <#df>|df}.ff(f)(.fff) ==> data format

{DO <#do>|do}.dddd ==> documents

{DP <#dp>|dp}.yy1mm1dd1-yy2mm2dd2 ==> data date period

{DS <#ds>|ds}.sss(sss) ==> data subcategory

{DT <#dt>|dt}.{hhnnss|aaaaaa} ==> data time

{FD <#fd>|fd}.cc(c) ==> flow direction

{FH <#fh>|fh}.hhhh(c) ==> forecast hour

{GP <#gp>|gp}.ppppp(pppp) ==> generating process

{GR <#gr>|gr}.gggggggg ==> grid

{LV <#lv>|lv}.sddddd grid ==> level of data

{LY <#ly>|ly}.sddddd1-sddddd2 ==> layer of data

{MR <#mr>|mr}.rrr ==> run of model

{MS <#ms>|ms}.ss(ssss) ==> model subcategory

{MT <#mt>|mt}.mmm(mm) ==> type of model

{NS <#ns>|ns}.xxx(xxxxxxxxxxxx) ==> name of storm

{PA <#pa>|pa}.pppppppp ==> parameter

{PT <#pt>|pt}.pppp ==> product type

{RD <#rd>|rd}.yyyymmdd ==> reference date

{RT <#rt>|rt}.hhnnss ==> reference time

{SD <#sd>|sd}.ccnnnxxx ==> server directory tree

{SF <#sf>|sf}.hhnnss ==>stat file

{SI <#si>|si}.aa(aaaaaaaa) ==> data site

{SN <#sn>|sn}.xx(xx) ==> sequence number

{ST <#st>|st}.ssss ==> status of data files

{TB <#tb>|tb}.tttt ==> tables

{TE <#te>|te}.ddhhnnss ==> time written

{TL <#tl>|tl}.ttttt ==> type of level or layer

{TP <#tp>|tp}.hh1nn1-hh2nn2 ==> data time period

 


        EXAMPLES

In the above, the notation {a|b} indicates a choice may be made to use
either "a" or "b". The convention suggested is to use upper case when
the information element is used in a directory name and lower case when
the information element is used in a file name. The specific description
of these information elements is given in Annex 1. It should be noted
that the above list of information elements is not exhaustive, and more
can be anticipated to be needed. Furthermore, several tables described
in Annex 1 are incomplete and others will need to be developed and
maintained by the center responsible for the server.

As a /first/ example, the US National Centers for Environmental
Prediction (NCEP) might choose to

assemble the above information elements into following directory and
file naming configuration for observational data:

*/(server location)/(reference date)/(reference time)/(generating
process)/(data time period)/*

* (area of data)_(data format)_(data category)_(data subcategory)*

Symbolically, this would appear as:

/SL.ccnnnsss/RD.yyyymmdd/RT.hhnnss/GP.ppppp/TP.hh_1 nn_1 -hh_2 nn_2 /
ar.aaaaaaaa_df.ff_dc.ccccc_ds.sssss

A file of radiosonde observations from fixed land sites for the period
from 3 hours prior to 2 hours 59 minutes after a reference date/time of
8 December, 1997/1200 UTC stored in BUFR on the NCEP DDBs server would
then appear as:

*/SL.us007003/RD.19971208/RT.120000/GP.obvns/TP.0300-0259/ar.allglobe_df.bu_dc.vsndn_ds.raobf*


Note that other centers would be free to organize their directory and
file names for the same observational data with a different combination
of information elements, or with the same information elements but in a
different order.

As a /second/ example, the US National Weather Service (NWS) might
choose to assemble the above elements into following directory and file
naming configuration for a specific observational data type:

*/(server location)/(area of data)/(data format)/(data
category)/(customer sequence number)*

Symbolically, this would appear as:

/SL.ccnnnsss/AR.aaaaaaaa/DF.ff/DC.ccccc/cu.lllll_sn.xx(xx)

A file of surface synoptic data for the area of South America in WMO
character code for use by a customer would appear as:

*/SL.us008001/AR.wmora03l/DF.an/DC.sflnd/cu.mitre_sn.01*

Note this is the first "cu.mitre" file of the "DC.sflnd" data type
subdirectory where there will be a number of sequences of sn=01 through
sn=36, for 36 different file names under that subdirectory. This
provides a way of generating files of data as they arrive at the
communications switching center. As the definition of area is not yet
defined here, this AR = wmo for World Meteorological Organization, ra
for region, 03 for region number of South America, and l (lower case L)
for continent specific area.


        Stat File

The _stat file_ is a mandatory file in the server root directory. This
file contains the last new file(s) by file name written on the server
from the time of the last written stat file. The stat file content
structure _would be defined by the center_; however, a suggested form
could be as follows.

*/CONTENT SAMPLE/*

*do.code_tb.bufr.dd.19990821_te.24133002* = is a new file added to the
stat file

where: {do.code_tb.bufr.dd.19990821} ==> Directory name(s) defined in
Annex 1 "Optional Fields"

{TE|te} ==> Indicator for information element "Time written"

*dd* ==> day written
*hh* ==> hour written (on 24 hour clock)
*nn* ==> minutes written
*ss* ==> seconds written

This would represent an entry in the stat file of a document on BUFR
code tables written on August 21, 1999 which was placed on the file
server on day 24, hour 13, minute 30 and, second 02.


        Server Directory Tree

The _directory tree_ is a mandatory file in the server root directory
which contains the directory structure of the server. The file content
contains a list of all directory/sub-directory names from /highest/ to
/lowest/ as defined by directory names from the Annex 1 listed "Selected
IDs" that are directories defined on this file server. (See Annex 2)

*Annex 2 : Server Directory Tree Description and Structure*

The contents of the *server directory tree* ==> {SD|sd}-ccnnnxxx

Directory trees in this file are designated with /### and the end of
each tree limb is flagged with ## ; therefore, any definition beyond the
## flag would be /file names/ within that sub-directory. Depending on
the size of the file server and extent of the directories and
sub-directories used, this file could be very large, but would map the
entire server site directory structure.

For Example: *sd-us008001* ==> file name of server directory map on the
RTH Washington (OSO Gateway) file server

Content structure of this file (assume a continuous string of fields in
the file):

/###RD.19971208_RT.120000_GP.obvns_TP.0300-0259
##RD.19991208_RT.120000_GP.warng_TP.0100-0359
##RD.19971208_RT.000000_GP.obvns_TP.0300-0259
##RD.19971207_RT.120000_GP.obvns_TP.0300-0259##
/###CU.knhc##
/###CU.ncep##
/###DO.drft_DD.19990305_TB.crex
##DO.code_DD.19990510
##DO.tcom_DD.19990818
##DO.tcom_DD.19990821##
/###CU.genrl_RD.19990605_DC.sfmar
##CU.genrl_RD.19990605_DC.sflnd
##CU.genrl_RD.19990604_DC.sfmar
##CU.genrl_RD.19990604_DC.sflnd
##CU.genrl_RD.19990603_DC.sfmar
##CU.genrl_RD.19990603_DC.sflnd##
	 

Taking the example set of defined directory tree limbs above, the more
familiar display format would look like:


        root


|----RD.19971208
