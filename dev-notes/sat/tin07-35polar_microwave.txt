SUBJECT:  NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL SATELLITE...DATA...AND 
          INFORMATION SERVICE POLAR SATELLITE MICROWAVE PRODUCTS  
          TO BE ADDED TO NOAAPORT: EFFECTIVE JULY 24 2007 

EFFECTIVE TUESDAY JULY 24 2007...BEGINNING AT APPROXIMATELY 1500 
COORDINATED UNIVERSAL TIME /UTC/...THE NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL 
SATELLITE...DATA...AND INFORMATION SERVICE /NESDIS/ AND NWS WILL 
BEGIN DISSEMINATION OF POLAR SATELLITE /MICROWAVE BASED/ PRODUCTS 
VIA NOAAPORT.

THIS ADDITION CONSISTS OF TWO PRODUCTS /I.E. TWO PARAMETERS/ 
...TOTAL PRECIPITABLE WATER /TPW/ ESTIMATES AND RAINFALL RATE 
ESTIMATES. 

ONE VERSION OF THESE PRODUCTS IS GENERATED BASED ON THE ADVANCED 
MICROWAVE SOUNDING UNIT /AMSU/ FROM THE NESDIS POLAR ORBITING 
OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL SATELLITES /POES/ AND ON THE EUROPEAN 
METEOROLOGICAL OPERATIONAL SATELLITE PROGRAMME /METOP/...WHEN THE 
METOP SPACECRAFT BECOMES FULLY OPERATIONAL IN MAY 2007. 

A SECOND VERSION OF THESE PRODUCTS IS GENERATED BASED ON THE 
SPECIAL SENSOR MICROWAVE IMAGER /SSMI/ FROM THE DEFENSE 
METEOROLOGICAL SATELLITE PROGRAM /DMSP/. 

BEGINNING WITH THE F-16 DMSP SPACECRAFT...THE SPECIAL SENSOR 
MICROWAVE IMAGER SOUNDER /SSMIS/ WILL REPLACE THE SSMI AS A BASIS 
FOR THESE PRODUCTS. INITIALLY MICROWAVE SENSOR DATA FROM THE 
FOLLOWING SPACECRAFT AND INSTRUMENTS WILL BE USED IN THE 
GENERATION OF THESE PRODUCTS AS FOLLOWS:

SPACECRAFT          INSTRUMENT
     
POES NOAA-15        AMSU
POES NOAA-17        AMSU
POES NOAA-18        AMSU
DMSP F-13           SSMI
DMSP F-14           SSMI

WHEN METOP-A BECOMES OPERATIONAL...ITS PRODUCTS WILL REPLACE 
NOAA-17 AMSU PRODUCTS.  NOAA-16 AND F-15 PRODUCTS WILL ALSO BE 
RESTORED AND ADDED TO THE PRODUCT SUITE. THUS... IN THE FUTURE... 
IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THESE PRODUCTS WILL BE BASED ON SENSOR 
DATA FROM THE FOLLOWING SPACECRAFT AND INSTRUMENTS:

SPACECRAFT          INSTRUMENT

POES NOAA-15        AMSU
POES NOAA-16        AMSU
POES NOAA-18        AMSU
METOP-A             AMSU
DMSP F-13           SSMI
DMSP F-14           SSMI
DMSP F-15           SSMI

OVER TIME...AS OLDER SPACECRAFT ARE RETIRED...DATA FROM NEWER 
SPACECRAFT AND INSTRUMENTS MAY BE BROUGHT ON LINE.

THE NOAAPORT-PRODUCED MICROWAVE PRODUCTS WILL BE PROVIDED FOR 
FOUR GEOGRAPHICAL REGIONS AS SHOWN BELOW IN TABLE 1. EACH TYPE OF 
PRODUCT WILL BE DISTRIBUTED AT A FREQUENCY OF APPROXIMATELY ONE 
PER HOUR. EACH PRODUCT WILL CONTAIN COMPOSITES OF MULTIPLE RECENT 
ORBITS. THE APPROXIMATE HORIZONTAL RESOLUTION OF THESE PRODUCTS 
WILL BE 8 KILOMETERS.

THE SUPERNATIONAL SECTORS COVER THE CONUS AREA AND THEY WILL BE 
DISSEMINATED VIA THE NOAAPORT GOES DVB CHANNEL /JOINING EXISTING 
NESDIS IMAGERY/. THE OFF CONUS SECTORS /I.E. ALASKA...HAWAII AND 
PUERTO RICO/ WILL BE DISSEMINATED VIA THE OCONUS DVB CHANNEL 
/ALSO CALLED THE FOURTH DVB CHANNEL/.  THE FORMAT OF THESE 
PRODUCTS IS SIMILAR TO THAT OF EXISTING NOAAPORT SATELLITE 
IMAGERY ON THOSE DVB CHANNELS...AND IS DESCRIBED IN THE INTERFACE 
CONTROL DOCUMENT FOR AWIPS AND NESDIS /USE LOWER CASE LETTERS 
EXCEPT FOR ICD AND CH/:

THE RAINFALL RATE PRODUCTS WILL PROVIDE COVERAGE OVER THE LAND 
AND MARINE AREAS...EXCEPT WHERE THERE IS SNOW ON THE GROUND OR
