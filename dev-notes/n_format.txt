      NOAAPORT Data Format

*/NOAAPORT/* Broadcast System (NBS) uses the concept of encapsulation
and the International Standards Organization (ISO) Open Systems
Interconnection (OSI) reference model to define its data transmission
format. The OSI reference model uses a seven-layer model to abstract the
necessary functionality for communications between computer systems. The
seven-layer model as shown contains the Physical Layer, Data-Link Layer,
Network Layer, Transport Layer, Session Layer, Presentation Layer, and
Application Layer.

The OSI reference model does not dictate the use of all layers for every
application. Rather, it encourages application developers to use the
functionality that is appropriate for their specific application. The
NBS uses only four layers: the physical layer, the data link layer
<datalink.shtml>, transport layer <transprt.shtml> and presentation
layer <presntn.shtml>.


OSI Reference Model vs. NOAAPORT diagram


The diagram illustrates the NBS architecture using the classic OSI
layers. This architecture uses a simplex broadcast scheme in which the
communications between layers is in one direction only, broadcast to
receiver. As a result, there is no flow control. The NBS uses high-level
data-link control (HDLC) framing for the Data-Link Layer and the
PRC-developed SBN protocol for the Transport Layer. The Presentation
Layer incorporates the World Meteorological Association (WMO)/NESDIS
headers for NESDIS products and the Communications Control Block
(CCB)/WMO headers for NWSTG products.

As the individual products are packaged for transmission, they are
enveloped by the headers of the Presentation, Transportation, and Link
protocol layers used by the NBS. As shown the products are first wrapped
in their corresponding Presentation Layer headers according to product
type. The NESDIS products use the WMO and NESDIS headers, and the NWSTG
products use the CCB/WMO headers. The first frame of a NESDIS product
contains only header information, while the succeeding frames contain
only the image data. Each frame of information contains one or more scan
lines of image data, which are approximately 5,120 bytes. Summing the
header data and the image data results in a NESDIS frame that can
contain up to 5,152 bytes. The first frame of an NWSTG product contains
the CCB/WMO header and product data. Succeeding frames contain only the
product data, with each NWSTG frame containing up to 4,000 bytes of
product data.

The next layer is the Transport Layer, which places the SBN protocol
headers around the product/image data and Presentation Layer headers.
The first frame of each distinct product of this layer contains the
frame-level header (FH), a product-definition header (PDH), an AWIPS
product-specific header (PSH), and the appropriate source data.
Subsequent frames of the same product contain the FH, the PDH, and the
appropriate source data.

The Transport Layer also contains several layers of sequence numbers.
The first level sequences the frames, allowing the protocol to recognize
lost frames. The next level sequences the products, which allows the
protocol to recognize lost or damaged products. The final level of
sequencing is used in reassembling the product. The sequence numbers do
not provide flow control. Their purpose is strictly error control.

The final layer before the data are converted to a radio frequency
signal and uplinked to the satellite is the Data-Link Layer. In this
layer, the "data" created by the Transport and Presentation Layers are
enveloped by an HDLC frame and stamped for error control with a frame
check sequence Cyclical Redundancy Check (CRC)-16.
