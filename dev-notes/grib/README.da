The data directory

	/var/noaaport/data/digatmos

has files that can be read by both DA and IDV. In particular,
those under the surface, syn, upperair and grib subdirectories.

There is some quirk in DA that must be worked around when dealing
with grib files. If you open DA and immediately try to open a grib file,
it will write an error that it cannot access the file.
I believe it is due to a bug in the DA initialization code (which is why
I had stopped working on the grib stuff in DA). 

The workaround is to first open some other data file, for example
a surface or upperair.
From the file menu, choose the "Import file" item. That file
will not be used, but it has the effect of trigering the initalization
code. After that, the grib files can be imported from the same File menu
or from the buttons on the left hand side pannel (at the bottom).
Then selcting the parameter to plot in that same pannel will
produce the display.

I have heard comments about DA not being able to handle large grib files,
crashing and so on. It has never happened to me. 
DA sometimes does take a long time to parse the file.
It will do it, and in the end the plots are nice, but there are some files
for which I take a walk and come back in a few minutes.

Most other programs make a first pass through the file to build
up a catalog and index of the file's contents.
When requested to make a plot they go
to the file again and get and decode the relevant data. It seems DA
decodes the file as it goes through it, all in one pass, and that takes
much longer time because all the data has to be decoded even if will
request just a few plots. But after that waiting period, it
does the plots well.

Anyway, all this is work in progress, and I would be glad to hear
confirmation/comments/suggestions about any of these things.
