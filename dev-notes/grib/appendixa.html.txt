WMO BULLETIN HEADER


           The WMO abbreviated heading is used to identify the NCEP GRIB
messages; however, it is not a complete description of their content. 
The user is cautioned against using the header as the sole determiner of
the record content; one should, of course, rely on the Product
Definition Section for that purpose.

            Note: In the following, a hexadecimal number is enclosed in
parentheses followed by the designation "hex".  The information needed
to identify the NCEP product is contained in 21 octets.  The characters
are encoded using the CCITT-ITA No. 5, also known (in the US) as ASCII
characters, and are defined as follows:

Octet
	Header Content
1
	The character 'H' for GRIB bulletins sent to the NWS Family of
Services, used for the WAFS program, and for general International Exchange
            or
The character ?O? for oceanographic GRIB bulletins intended for general
International and National Exchange and for use in the NWS AWIPS program
            or
The characters 'L', 'M', 'Y' or 'Z' for meteorological GRIB bulletins
intended for the NWS AWIPS program.
2
	A letter character specifying the type parameter as shown in Table A.1
<#table-a1>.
3
	A letter character specifying the grid area as defined in Table A.2
<#table-a2>.
4
	A letter or numeric character indicating the time difference between
the reference time and valid time of the data as listed in Table A.3
<#table-a3>, i.e., the forecast length.
5-6
	Numeric characters as defined in Table A.4 <#table-a4>.  Usually the
pressure level, sometimes just a sequence number.  Some values have
special level or layer meanings.
7
	Blank (20)hex
8-11
	Four characters identifying the originating center.  The first three
characters are always ?KWB? for NCEP-produced messages.  The last
character is a letter specifying the NCEP model as defined in Table A.5
<#table-a5>.
12
	Blank (20)hex
13-14
	Two numeric characters providing the reference day of the month (01-31)
of the data.
15-18
	Four numeric characters providing the reference hour and minute of the
data.
19-22
	Four OPTIONAL characters: one blank (20)hex, then 'Pxx', where xx=AA,
AB, AC ... AY,AZ, BA, BB, BC ... etc.  Used to indicate sequential parts
of a very long message that has been subdivided. The *last* part of the
message will have xx=Zn, where n is the next letter in the appropriate
sequence.  Example: a five part message would have the parts indicated
by PAA, PAB, PAC, PAD, PZE.
19-21 or 23-25
	Two ASCII carriage returns and a line feed, (0D0D0A)hex.



The first six characters are commonly referred to as:

T_1 T_2 A_1 A_2   ii

In summary...

Generic Meaning of   T_1   T_2   A_1   A_2   ii:

                        T_1 :        Type of bulletin:  "H" for GRIB
messages for
                                                                       
Family of Services, WAFS, and
                                                                       
International Exchange;
                                                                ?O? and
"E" for Oceanographic GRIB messages
                                                                       
for National and International Exchange
                                                                       
and for AWIPS GRIB messages; or
                                                                "L",
"M", "Y" or "Z" for AWIPS GRIB messages

                        T_2 :        Type of data/parameter

                        A_1 :       Grid

                        A_2 :       Analysis or forecast hour

ii:          Numeric.  Usually the pressure level, sometimes just a
sequence number.  Some values have special level or layer meanings.

            In the following tables, the columns headed AWIPS are
augmentations to the common Family of Services (FOS), National, and
International Exchange variables.  FOS, National and International GRIB
messages (with H as the initial character) draw upon the left hand
columns only.  National, International, and AWIPS GRIB messages (with O
as the initial character) draw upon the middle column only.  AWIPS GRIB
messages (with Y or Z as the initial character) use letters from both
the left and right columns.  If each column contains entries for the
same designator, the T_1 character (H, O, L, M, Y, or Z) indicates which
entry to use.

The WMO headings for Eta model products generated on grid 237 (Puerto
Rico) and RUC model products generated on grid 236 (CONUS 40 km)
