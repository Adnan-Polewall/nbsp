- The file "gribtonc.entries" is the one from the "decoders" package
  from unidata.

- The file "grib.m4-gempak" is the original grib.m4 I constructed
  out of the corresponding gempak file. It's mainly for documentation
  purposes.

- Combining what I guessed from this two, I built grib.m4-start
  which I used as the starting point for the grib.m4 in the dafilter.

- It seems that the file produced by the "gfs" rule cannot be read
  by DA nor IDV. It seems that eta, ruc2, ecmwf are fine.

- The file "GRIB.html" came from
  http://weather.unisys.com/wxp/Appendices/Formats/GRIB.html

- The file "appendixa.html" comes from
  http://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/docs/on388/

- The file UNPKGRIB.315.pdf comes from a nws site and contains
  the grib2 file format. See also:

- The files model_summary.html and xr07_Center_ID_List.html were used
  for constructing the model names in filters/filterlib/filtersgribid.rc
