- radplaces.txt was extracted from radar_places.txt from Gibson Ridge.
- radsites.txt was extracted from radstations.txt, which in turn
  was extracted from the NWS prod.hdrs.html

It is clear that the four-letter code used in radplaces.txt is the
three-letter code for the site, with the same first letter of
the corresponding station (office) pre-pended.
The file s.awk, applied to radsites.txt, yields the four-letter
code that coincides with the radplaces.txt list.
