nexrad-stations.csv was extacted from nexrad-stations.txt
(which is a copy of the nexrad-stations.TXT refered to below)
using cvt-nexrad-stations.tcl. It is the file used in the gisfilter.

There is a correction in nexrad-stations.csv. This is the file used
in the gisfilter.

radplaces-2.txt was extracted from nexrad-stations.txt, which is a copy of

	https://mi3.ncdc.noaa.gov//mi3report/MISC/nexrad-stations.TXT

by filtering it through the s2.awk script, and eliminating the entries
from Korea, Japan and Azores. It was not used any further.

The sample file tdwr.cfg (in the ondas examples directory) was
created using the information in tdwr-radar-list.pdf.

A template for the dual polarization products was also created in the
ondas example directory (using newproducts-2010/radar.txt).

Original -

- radplaces.txt was extracted from radar_places.txt from Gibson Ridge.
- radsites.txt was extracted from radstations.txt, which in turn
  was extracted from the NWS prod.hdrs.html

It is clear that the four-letter code used in radplaces.txt is the
three-letter code for the site, with the same first letter of
the corresponding station (office) pre-pended.
The file s.awk, applied to radsites.txt, yields the four-letter
code that coincides with the radplaces.txt list.
