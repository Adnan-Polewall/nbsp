Unisys Internet Delivered Weather Products

Products: DIFAX, DOMESTIC DATA, PUBLIC PRODUCTS, INTERNATIONAL DATA, RADAR AND FAA-604 AVIATION WEATHER

Internet Delivery Methods:

Two methods are available; the Internet Data Distribution Service (via LDM), and the Internet Data Access Service (via FTP):

1) Internet Data Distribution Service:

This service utilizes Internet "push" technology to push the weather data to your computer system. In order to receive this data clients will need to install the Unidata Local Data Manager (LDM). LDM is a collection of cooperating programs that select, capture, manage, and distribute meteorological data products. The system is designed for event-driven data distribution. The LDM5 software is currently freely available via anonymous FTP in source form or as binaries for several supported platforms from the Unidata Program Center (www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/ldm/index.html). This site also offers a host of documentation, frequently asked questions, and even installation checklists.

Unisys is also offering an inexpensive PC fully configured with LDM and ready to "plug and play" for those customers that would prefer this convenience (please call for pricing).

2) Internet Data Access Service:

The Data Access Service consists of an FTP server that allows clients to "pull" weather data to their computer system. Unisys will be providing low-cost software for scheduled downloading of this data, for those customers that would like to purchase it.

The entire team at Unisys Weather Information Services looks forward to the opportunity to serve as your weather data provider.
