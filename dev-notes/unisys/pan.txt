Product arrival notices are sent at the completion of a product to a specified PAN receiving program.  The PAN receiver will use this message to trigger an action based on the arrival of that product.  For example, a PAN receiver might be interested in the arrival of severe thunderstorm warning messages so it can warn the user.  The PAN message is broadcast over a socket using a UDP transmission.  This is a connectionless process where the PAN is sent to a specific address and port and it is up to the PAN receiver to be active and waiting for the message using a receive from call.
