Protocols

	- NBSFP (NBS filter protocol)
	- NBS1  (noaaport sbn lite for emwin-type clients) 
	- EMWIN (the usual)


- NBSFP (Logger to server and filters)
  [Defined in pack.c and used in server.c (and by any filter).] 

  It consists of
  
	-----------
	| envelope |
	-----------
	| data     |
	------------

where the envelope is 

   * 1 byte for the data id
   * 4 bytes for the data size
   * 4 bytes for the data size (repeated).
   * 4 bytes for the checksum of the data

and the data is

   *  byte[0-3]: pdh_product_seq_number
   *  byte[4]: psh_product_type
   *  byte[5]: psh_product_category
   *  byte[6]: psh_product_code
   *  byte[7]: not used
   *  variable: full path of file (without the trailing NULL)


- NBS1
  [Defined in nbs.[ch] and used in server.c]

  Consists of

	   ----------
	   | Header |
	   ----------
	   | Data   |
	   ----------

where the header is

 * byte[0] - uchar - version number (should be 1)
 * byte[1] - uchar - size of this header (should be 24)
 * byte[2] - uchar - not used, should be 0
 * byte[3] - uchar - not used, should be 0
 * byte[4-7] - uint32 - seq_number
 * byte[8] - uchar - psh_product_type
 * byte[9] - uchar - psh_product_category
 * byte[10] - uchar - psh_product_code
 * byte[11] - uchar - compressed flag
 * byte[12-13] - uint16 - num_blocks (n >= 1)
 * byte[14-15] - uint16 - block_number  (1 to n; not 0 to n)
 * byte[16-19] - uint32 - checksum of data portion in this packet (byte 24 ...)
 * byte[20-23] - unit32 - data size (how much more to read)
 *
 * - The uint32 values are stored with the first byte the most significant
 *   digits, last byte the least significant one.
 *
 * - It is guanranteed that, before and after decompression, the data is never
 *   larger than the constant NBS1_BLOCK_SIZE.

and the data is the product (fragments) itself. So the data portion starts
at byte[24].
