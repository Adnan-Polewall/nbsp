SERVICE CHANGE NOTICE 10-06
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE HEADQUARTERS WASHINGTON DC
255 PM EST FRI JAN 15 2010

TO:        SUBSCRIBERS:
           -FAMILY OF SERVICES
           -NOAA WEATHER WIRE SERVICE
           -EMERGENCY MANAGERS WEATHER INFORMATION NETWORK
           -NOAAPORT
           OTHER NWS PARTNERS...AND NWS EMPLOYEES

FROM:      THERESE Z. PIERCE
           CHIEF...MARINE AND COASTAL SERVICES BRANCH

SUBJECT:   ADOPTION AND USE OF /POST-TROPICAL CYCLONE/
           TERMINOLOGY BY NWS NATIONAL CENTERS AND FORECAST
           OFFICES: EFFECTIVE MAY 15 2010

ON MAY 15 2010...THE NWS WILL BEGIN USING THE TERM /POST-
TROPICAL/ TO DESCRIBE WEATHER SYSTEMS THAT ARE NO LONGER
TROPICAL CYCLONES. THIS CHANGE WILL MAKE NWS TERMINOLOGY
CONSISTENT WITH THE TERMINOLOGY USED BY OTHER WORLD
METEOROLOGICAL ORGANIZATION MEMBER STATES. IT WILL ALSO ALLOW
THE NWS TO MORE ACCURATELY DESCRIBE THE METEOROLOGICAL STRUCTURE
OF FORMER TROPICAL CYCLONES.

THE FOLLOWING DEFINITION FOR POST-TROPICAL CYCLONE WILL BE
INCLUDED IN THIS SEASON/S UPDATE OF NWS INSTRUCTION
10-604: TROPICAL CYCLONE DEFINITIONS.

POST-TROPICAL CYCLONE...A FORMER TROPICAL CYCLONE. THIS GENERIC
TERM DESCRIBES A CYCLONE THAT NO LONGER POSSESSES SUFFICIENT
TROPICAL CHARACTERISTICS TO BE CONSIDERED A TROPICAL CYCLONE.
POST-TROPICAL CYCLONES CAN CONTINUE CARRYING HEAVY RAINS AND
HIGH WINDS. FORMER TROPICAL CYCLONES THAT HAVE BECOME FULLY
EXTRATROPICAL...AS WELL AS REMNANT LOWS...ARE TWO SPECIFIC
CLASSES OF POST-TROPICAL CYCLONES.

AS SUGGESTED BY THE ABOVE DEFINITION...THE NWS WILL CONTINUE TO
USE THE MORE SPECIFIC TERMS OF /REMNANT LOW/ AND /EXTRATROPICAL/
... WHEN APPLICABLE... TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE
TYPE OF SYSTEM THE TROPICAL CYCLONE HAS OR IS EXPECTED TO
BECOME. UPDATED DEFINITIONS OF REMNANT LOW AND EXTRATROPICAL
CYCLONE FOLLOW.

REMNANT LOW...A POST-TROPICAL CYCLONE THAT NO LONGER POSSESSES
THE CONVECTIVE ORGANIZATION REQUIRED OF A TROPICAL CYCLONE...AND
HAS MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS OF LESS THAN 34 KNOTS. THE TERM IS
MOST COMMONLY APPLIED TO THE NEARLY DEEP-CONVECTION-FREE SWIRLS
OF STRATOCUMULUS IN THE EASTERN NORTH PACIFIC.

EXTRATROPICAL CYCLONE...A CYCLONE OF ANY INTENSITY FOR WHICH THE
PRIMARY ENERGY SOURCE IS BAROCLINIC /THAT IS...RESULTS FROM THE
TEMPERATURE CONTRAST BETWEEN WARM AND COLD AIR MASSES/.

THE FOLLOWING EXAMPLE SHOWS HOW THE NEW TERMINOLOGY WOULD BE
USED IN THE TABLE SECTION OF A TROPICAL CYCLONE DISCUSSION
PRODUCT FOR THE LAST ADVISORY ON A DECAYING TROPICAL STORM.

IN THIS EXAMPLE...THE SYSTEM HAS LOST THE DEEP CONVECTION
REQUIRED OF A TROPICAL CYCLONE BUT IT DOES NOT YET HAVE ANY
FRONTAL CHARACTERISTICS.  IN ADDITION THE SYSTEM CANNOT BE
DESIGNATED A REMNANT LOW BECAUSE ITS MAXIMUM WINDS EXCEED
34 KNOTS.  THEREFORE THE SYSTEM IS MERELY DESCRIBED AS
POST-TROPICAL AT THE INITIAL TIME. IN 24 HOURS...HOWEVER...THE
SYSTEM IS FORECAST TO CHANGE STRUCTURE AND BECOME A FRONTAL LOW.
THE /EXTRATROPICAL/ DESIGNATION IS THEREFORE APPENDED IN THE
TABLE TO INDICATE THIS FORECAST CHANGE IN STRUCTURE.

INFORMATION OF LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE AND ALTITUDE WILL RELY ON
THE WORLD GEODETIC SYSTEM 1984 /WGS84/ STANDARD.

BE ADVISED PARTS OF THE UPPER AIR CODED MESSAGES WILL BE
SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER WITH RRS CONVERSION.  NWS HAS COORDINATED
WITH ITS PARTNERS ON THE LONGER LENGTH OF THESE MESSAGES.

             SEASON

EFFECTIVE WITH THE 2010 HURRICANE SEASON... THE NATIONAL
HURRICANE CENTER /NHC/ WILL IMPLEMENT NEW ISSUANCE CRITERIA TO
INCREASE THE LEAD TIME ASSOCIATED WITH TROPICAL CYCLONE WATCHES
AND WARNINGS BY 12 HOURS. THIS INCREASE IN LEAD TIME HAS BEEN
MADE POSSIBLE BY IMPROVEMENTS IN TROPICAL CYCLONE TRACK
FORECASTING OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES. THE CHANGE IS EFFECTIVE
ON MAY 15 2010 FOR THE EASTERN PACIFIC HURRICANE BASIN AND ON
JUNE 1 2010 FOR THE ATLANTIC HURRICANE BASIN.

TROPICAL STORM WATCHES WILL GENERALLY BE ISSUED WHEN TROPICAL
STORM CONDITIONS ARE POSSIBLE ALONG THE COAST WITHIN 48 HOURS.
TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS WILL BE ISSUED WHEN THESE CONDITIONS ARE
EXPECTED WITHIN 36 HOURS.

SIMILAR INCREASES IN LEAD TIME WILL APPLY TO HURRICANE WATCHES
AND WARNINGS. THE HURRICANE WATCHES AND WARNINGS WILL GENERALLY
BE TIMED TO PROVIDE 48 AND 36 HOURS OF NOTICE...RESPECTIVELY...
BEFORE THE ONSET OF TROPICAL-STORM-FORCE WINDS. THIS THRESHOLD
FORCES A SUSPENSION OF MANY HURRICANE PREPAREDNESS ACTIVITIES.
