WMO Super Heading Reference

World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Headings have the

	   format of T1T2A1A2ii CCCC .


WMO super headings are used to aggregate products for the
same parameter (NDFD element) and sector.  These aggregate
products contain individual products for all forecast periods.
For these aggregate products the WMO super headings are
consistent with those for individual NDFD products except in
the super headings, the  A2 is always Z.

The CCCC for all SPC product WMO headings is KWNS (indicating
they are produced by SPC)

The T1 = L, M, V and E for all GRIB2 and Y, Z, H and O 
for GRIB1 (GRIB1 will become obsolete in the near future) product WMO headings.

The T2 indicates the elements: 

A = UNASSIGNED
