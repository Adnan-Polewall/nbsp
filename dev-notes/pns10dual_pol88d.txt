SUBJECT: SOLICITING COMMENTS BY MARCH 19 2010 ON PLANS TO
         ADD DUAL POLARIZATION WSR-88D PRODUCTS TO SBN/NOAAPORT
         AND RPCCDS: EFFECTIVE WITH WSR-88D DUAL POLARIZATION
         /NOVEMBER 2010 BETA TEST/

NWS HAS DEVELOPED PROPOSED OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS TO DISTRIBUTE 
DUAL POLARIZATION WEATHER SURVEILLANCE RADAR-1988... DOPPLER 
/WSR-88D/ PRODUCTS VIA SATELLITE BROADCAST NETWORK /SBN/... 
NOAAPORT AND RADAR PRODUCT CENTRAL COLLECTION DISSEMINATION 
SERVICE /RPCCDS/. 

NWS IS REQUESTING COMMENTS THROUGH MARCH 19 2010 ON THE 
PROPOSED REQUIREMENTS AND IMPLEMENTATION PLAN. SEND COMMENTS TO:

TIM.D.CRUM@NOAA.GOV 
MICHAEL.ISTOK@NOAA.GOV.

IF THE PROPOSED CHANGE IS APPROVED... WE ANTICIPATE IMPLEMENTATION
IN THE NOVEMBER 2010 TIMEFRAME. TABLE 1 CONTAINS THE LIST OF DUAL
POLARIZATION RADAR PRODUCTS PROPOSED TO BE DISTRIBUTED VIA THE 
RPCCDS AND SBN/NOAAPORT. THIS DISSEMINATION WILL BEGIN WITH BETA 
TESTING OF THE FIRST DUAL POLARIZATION WSR-88D SITE. OTHER BETA 
TEST SITES WILL BE ADDED AS THEY ARE MODIFIED. DURING THIS TEST 
PERIOD... NWS WILL EVALUATE COMMUNICATIONS LOADING FOR IMPACTS 
AND DECIDE WHETHER TO DISSEMINATE DUAL POLARIZATION PRODUCTS
FROM ADDITIONAL SITES MODIFIED DURING FULL SCALE DEPLOYMENT.

IF THE ADDITION OF THESE PRODUCTS CAUSES AN OPERATIONAL IMPACT TO
NOAAPORT... THE FALLBACK PLAN IS TO DISTRIBUTE DUAL POLARIZATION
PRODUCTS ONLY VIA RPCCDS... WHICH WOULD BE DONE BY FILTERING SDUS8I 
PRODUCTS FROM THE NOAAPORT UPLINK. THIS FALLBACK 
PLAN REQUIRES EXCLUSIVE USE OF SDUS8I FOR DUAL POLARIZATION. 
CURRENTLY THE DIGITAL PRECIPITATION ARRAY PRODUCT /DPA/ HAS THE 
FOLLOWING HEADING: SDUS8I. CONSEQUENTLY THE PRODUCT IN TABLE 2 
WILL BE CHANGED NATIONALLY TO SDUS5I BEFORE BEGINNING DISSEMINATION 
OF DUAL POLARIZATION PRODUCTS.

WHEN FULLY IMPLEMENTED THE NOAAPORT AND RPCCDS COMMUNICATIONS
THROUGHPUT OF WSR-88D PRODUCTS WILL INCREASE BY A FACTOR OF 2.8
ABOVE WHAT WILL BE REACHED AFTER COMPLETING PRODUCT ADDITIONS 
DESCRIBED IN TECHNICAL IMPLEMENATION NOTICE 09-41. FOR EACH 
WSR-88D... THE AVERAGE HOURLY PRODUCT VOLUME VIA RPCCDS WILL BE 
APPROXIMATELY 14.5 MEGABYTES /MB/ AND THE AVERAGE DAILY VOLUME 
WILL BE 345.8 MB. WHEN FULLY IMPLEMENTED THE AVERAGE DAILY 
VOLUME FOR ALL WSR-88D RADARS WILL BE 53.9 GIGABYTES /GB/. WORST
CASE HOURLY THROUGHPUT IS ESTIMATED TO REACH 48 MB FOR A SINGLE 
RADAR AND 4.2 GB FOR ALL 200 RADARS /155 WSR-88D AND 45 TDWR/. 
ON NOAAPORT... PRODUCTS ARE FURTHER COMPRESSED AND THEREFORE 
THROUGHPUT WILL BE REDUCED SOMEWHAT.

ON THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS OPERATIONS CENTER /TOC/ FTP SERVER...
RADAR PRODUCTS WILL BE PLACED IN THE PRODUCT NAMED SUBDIRECTORY
LISTED IN TABLE 1 BELOW THE FOLLOWING DIRECTORY:

  FTP://TGFTP.NWS.NOAA.GOV/SL.US008001/DF.OF/DC.RADAR/
