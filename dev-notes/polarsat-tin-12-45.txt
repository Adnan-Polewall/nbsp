Hello everyone,

I got the below from NOAA last week. They are adding a new NOAAport
channel (see the announcement below my .sig for details). Thus, as of
early next month, for those of you who use the LDM NOAAport ingester with
version 6.11.0 (current version), you'll need to have this in your
ldmd.conf:

# dvbs shared memory ingest processes
exec    "dvbs_multicast -n -m 224.0.1.1"
exec    "dvbs_multicast -n -m 224.0.1.2"
exec    "dvbs_multicast -n -m 224.0.1.3"
exec    "dvbs_multicast -n -m 224.0.1.4"
exec    "dvbs_multicast -n -m 224.0.1.5"  <-----this is new

# readnoaaport shared memory readers
exec    "readnoaaport -m 224.0.1.1"
exec    "readnoaaport -m 224.0.1.2"
exec    "readnoaaport -m 224.0.1.3"
exec    "readnoaaport -m 224.0.1.4"
exec    "readnoaaport -m 224.0.1.5"  <-----this is new

Anyway, read on for the tech message, if you haven't seen it yet.
When I updated our LDM on the NOAAport ingester this afternoon, I added
the two entries above to my ldmd.conf.

Gilbert

Technical Implementation Notice 12-45

Subject:  Addition of Alaska Region NPP VIIRS Imagery to NOAAPORT
       Test Channel Effective October 2, 2012

On or about Tuesday, October 2, 2012, beginning approximately
1500 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), high resolution imagery
from the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (NPP)
satellite will be broadcast across the NOAAPORT satellite
broadcast network. This addition will consist of a limited set of
NPP Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) imagery
covering the Alaska region. The imagery stream will be provided
by the NOAA National Environmental Satellite, Data, and
Information Service (NESDIS) NPP Data Exploitation (NDE) system,
based on NPP VIIRS imagery Environmental Data Records (EDRs).

The new NPP VIIRS imagery products will be transmitted across a
test channel of the NOAAPORT satellite broadcast network.

-Digital Video Broadcast (DVB) packet identifier: 105
-Multicast address: 224.0.1.5
-Port number: 1205
-SBN Data Stream field setting in their frame-level headers: 7

NWS anticipates this NOAAPORT channel will be populated with
additional polar-orbiting satellite imagery. For clarity, this
channel will be referred to as the POLARSAT.

The Alaska region NPP VIIRS imagery will, in general, be within
the following latitude-longitude box:

Lower/Southern Latitude:  45 degrees North
Upper/Northern Latitude:  75 degrees North
Left/Western Longitude:  120 degrees East
Right/Eastern Longitude: 120 degrees West

This initial set of imagery products will be based on three NPP
VIIRS I channels, the horizontal resolution of which, at nadir,
is approximately 375 meters.

The imagery products will be formatted in netCDF4, but compressed
via gzip. Like all NOAAPORT products, each file will have a plain
text WMO heading at its start. These headings are listed below.

TIPB01 KNES - Imagery Channel 1 (0.64?m)
TIPB04 KNES - Imagery Channel 4 (3.74?m)
TIPB05 KNES - Imagery Channel 5 (11.45?m)

The "P" in the third character place of the WMO Heading
distinguishes this NPP-VIIRS imagery from pre-existing NOAAPORT
satellite imagery.

To access these products, users should take the following steps:

-Read beyond or strip off the WMO heading
-Decompress the resulting product, e.g., via gunzip
-Use a netCDF4 reader, e.g., a decoder that invokes the Unidata
netCDF4 software package

Each product will consist of one granule of VIIRS imagery for a
single channel. The VIIRS granules will cover approximately
86 seconds of data, roughly 5 degrees or 556 kilometers of along-
track geographical extent.

Unlike existing NOAAPORT satellite imagery, formatted on
prescribed maps, each NPP VIIRS imagery granule will be uniquely
located. Geolocation information is contained in each product
file. The geolocation information consists of three
1541-dimension arrays of latitude/longitude pairs that correspond
to the granule edge (first column), granule centerline, and
granule edge (last column), with all three arrays oriented along
the satellite track.

Given the fixed resolution and gridded Ground Track Mercator
representation of the VIIRS imagery, only these three columns of
geographical information (latitudes and longitudes) are required
to map the imagery. This reduced geolocation information can be
interpreted based on the VIIRS Ground Track Mercator imagery
algorithm (fine 375 meter resolution version) for accurate
georeferencing. Related information (though not specific to the
NOAAPORT stream of NPP VIIRS imagery) can be found in the
following document: "Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS)
Operational Algorithm Description (OAD) Document for VIIRS Ground
Track Mercator (GTM) Imagery Environmental Data Record (EDR)
Software," Revision A, January 18, 2012, (e.g., section 2.0.4).

The NOAAPORT feed of NPP VIIRS imagery is provided across a test
channel of the satellite broadcast network. This NOAAPORT channel
is under test and evaluation.  Product availability across this
channel is nonetheless expected to approach or meet that of
operational/baseline data (i.e., greater than 95% data
availability). If the experimental period is successful, NWS
intends to transition this NOAAPORT stream to full operational
posture in early 2013.

the NOAAPORT NPP VIIRS imagery feed please contact:
