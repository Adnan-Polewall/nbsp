Jose:

Does this help any??? It's from the author of Grlevelx.....

I want everyone with warning servers to add a new warning file
format/method. The current warning file setup results in many hits on the
servers and four different URLs to check in the GR apps. The new warning
system would reduce all that to a single hit on a single URL for all
warnings and SVS statements. Here's an example pqact.conf statement that
implements the new system:

Code:
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Write all relevant statements to a single file, keep control chars

WMO    ^...... .... ([0-3][0-9])([0-2][0-9]).*/p(SVR|TOR|FFW|SVS|SMW|MWS)
       FILE   data/warnings/warnings_(\1:yyyy)(\1:mm)\1_\2.txt
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This does several important things:

1) Preserves the control characters in the statements
2) Packs all the warning statements in a single file
3) Reduces hits on the server (and 404 errors)
4) Allows for easy expansion of the types of statements

Preserving the control chars makes the statement retrieval more robust and
allows the GR apps to "stream" the data (since it knows when it encounters
the end of a statement). Internally, the GR apps will read the statements
and route them appropriately. This allows implementors to easily include
more types of statements in the warning file -- e.g. note how the pqact.conf
statement above includes Special Marine Warnings. Those would be ignored
until support for them is implemented in the programs.

Of course, the older warning distribution needs to be maintained for a
considerable amount of time for backwards compatibility. Adding this new
method will result in a negligible hit on a server.

Anyway, I'd like to hear if there are any objections to this new method or
its proposed implementation. 

Thanks,
Mike

Gary

I know that the grl app changed the way it searches for the warnings, and
now instead of the files named like

	2012032302.TOR
	2012032303.FFW
etc, it instead looks for a single file named like

	warnings_20120324_22.txt

I implemented that in your server, similar to what you see at

	http://warnings.cod.edu

I am confident the server is configured correctly, but I don't enough about
the GR app to guess where the problem could be. Of course I could have made
a mistake, but I don't think so!

Jose
