<h1 class="SECTION"><a id="UDP-BUFFER-SIZING" name="UDP-BUFFER-SIZING">8. UDP Buffer
Sizing</a></h1>

<p>There are many questions surrounding UDP buffer sizing. What is the optimal size? What
are the consequences of an improperly sized UDP buffer? What are the equations needed to
compute an appropriate size for a UDP buffer? What default limit will the OS kernel place
on UDP buffer size and how can I change it? How can I tell if I'm having UDP loss
problems due to buffers that are too small? Answers to these questions and more are given
in the following sections.</p>

<div class="SECTION">
<h2 class="SECTION"><a id="UDP-BUFFER-OPTIMAL-SIZE" name="UDP-BUFFER-OPTIMAL-SIZE">8.1.
Optimal UDP Buffer Sizing</a></h2>

<p>UDP buffer sizes should be large enough to allow an application to endure the normal
variance in CPU scheduling latency without suffering packet loss. They should also be
small enough to prevent the application from having to read through excessively old data
following an unusual spike in CPU scheduling latency.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECTION">
<h2 class="SECTION"><a id="UDP-BUFFER-SMALL-CONSEQUENCES"
name="UDP-BUFFER-SMALL-CONSEQUENCES">8.2. UDP Buffer Space Too Small:
Consequences</a></h2>

<p>Too little UDP buffer space causes the operating system kernel to discard UDP packets.
The resulting packet loss has consequences described below.</p>

<p>The kernel often keeps counts of UDP packets received and lost. See <a
href="udp-buffer-sizing.html#DETECTING-UDP-LOSS">Section 8.9</a> for information on
detecting UDP loss due to UDP buffer space overflow. A common myth is that all UDP loss
is bad (see <a href="packet-loss-myths.html#MYTH-ALL-PACKET-LOSS-BAD">Myth: All Packet
Loss is Bad</a>).</p>
</div>

<div class="SECTION">
<h2 class="SECTION"><a id="UDP-LOSS-CONSEQUENCES" name="UDP-LOSS-CONSEQUENCES">8.3. UDP
Loss: Consequences</a></h2>

<p>In most cases, it's the secondary effects of UDP loss that matter most. That is, it's
the <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">reaction</i></span> to the loss that has
material consequences more so than the loss itself. Note that the consequences discussed
here are independent of the <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">cause</i></span>
of the loss. Inadequate UDP receive buffering is just one of the more common causes we've
encountered deploying <b class="APPLICATION">LBM</b>.</p>

<p>Consider these areas when assessing the consequences of UDP loss:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">Latency</i></span>--The time that passes
between the initial transmission of a UDP packet and the eventual successful reception of
a retransmission is latency that could have been avoided were it not for the intervening
loss.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">Bandwidth</i></span>--UDP loss usually
results in requests for retransmission, unless more up-to-date information is expected
soon (e.g. in the case of stock quote updates). Bandwidth used for retransmissions may
become significant, especially in cases where there is a large amount of loss or a large
number of receivers experiencing loss. See <a
href="multicast-retransmissions.html">Section 15</a> for more information on multicast
retransmissions.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">CPU Time</i></span>--UDP loss causes the
receiver to use CPU time to detect the loss, request one or more retransmissions, and
perform the repair. Note that efficiently dealing with loss among a group of receivers
requires the use of many timers, often of short-duration. Scheduling and processing such
timers generally requires CPU time in both the operating system kernel ("system time")
and in the application receiving UDP ("user time"). Additional CPU time is required to
switch between kernel and user modes.</p>

<p>On the sender, CPU time is used to process retransmission requests and to send
retransmissions as appropriate. As on the receiver, many timers are required for
efficient retransmission processing, thus requiring many switches between kernel and user
modes.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">Memory</i></span>--UDP receivers that can
only process data in the order that it was initially sent must allocate memory while
waiting for retransmissions to arrive. UDP loss causes such receivers to receive data in
an order different than that used by the sender. Memory is used to restore the order in
which it was initially sent.</p>

<p>Even UDP receivers that <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">can</i></span>
process UDP packets in the order they arrive may not be able to tolerate duplication of
packets. Such receivers must allocate memory to track which packets have been
successfully processed and which have not.</p>

<p>UDP senders interested in reliable reception by their receivers must allocate memory
to retain UDP packets after their initial transmission. Retained packets are used to fill
retransmission requests.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="SECTION">
<h2 class="SECTION"><a id="UDP-BUFFER-LARGE-CONSEQUENCES"
name="UDP-BUFFER-LARGE-CONSEQUENCES">8.4. UDP Buffer Space Too Large:
Consequences</a></h2>

<p>Even though too little UDP buffer space is definitely bad and more is generally
better, it is still possible to have too much of a good thing. Perhaps the two most
significant consequences of too much UDP buffer space are slower recovery from loss and
physical memory usage. Each of these is discussed in turn below.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">Slower Recovery</i></span>--To best
understand the consequences of too much UDP buffer space, consider a stream of packets
that regularly updates the current value of a rapidly-changing variable in every tenth
packet. Why buffer more than ten packets? Doing so would only increase the number of
stale packets that must be discarded at the application layer. Given a data stream like
this, it's generally better to configure a ten-packet buffer in the kernel so that no
more than ten stale packets have to be read by the application before a return to fresh
ones from the stream.</p>

<p>It's often counter-intuitive, but excessive UDP buffering can actually increase the
recovery time following a large packet loss event. UDP receive buffers should be sized to
match the latency budget allocated for CPU scheduling latency with knowledge of expected
data rates. See <a href="messaging-latency-budget.html">Section 16</a> for more
information on latency budgets. See <a
href="udp-buffer-sizing.html#UDP-BUFFER-EQUATION-SIZE">Section 8.6</a> for a UDP buffer
sizing equation.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">Physical Memory Usage</i></span>--It is
possible to exhaust available physical memory with UDP buffer space. Requesting a UDP
receive buffer of 32 MB and then invoking ten receiver applications uses 320 MB of
physical memory. See <a
href="udp-buffering-background.html#UDP-BUFFER-LIMIT-RATIONALE">Section 7.4</a> for more
information.</p>

UDP Loss</a></h2>

<p>Interpreting the output of <tt class="COMMAND">netstat</tt> is important in detecting
UDP loss. Unfortunately, the output varies considerably from one flavor of Unix to
another. Hence we can't give one set of instructions that will work with all flavors.</p>

<p>For each Unix flavor, we tested under normal conditions and then under conditions
forcing UDP loss while keeping a close eye on the output of <tt class="COMMAND">netstat
-s</tt> before and after the tests. This revealed the statistics that appeared to have a
relationship with UDP packet loss. Output from Solaris and FreeBSD <tt
