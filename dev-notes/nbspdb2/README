This the implementation of the nbspdb as a RECNO db. The problem
with this implementation is the requirement of the secondary db
to be able to search the elements by the sequence number.

The advantege of the implementation in terms of the fname
is the absence of the secondary db, which apparently makes
it faster. I decided to stick with the old version.
