This is the first release of TclGempak, a library of Tcl procedures
to execute Gempak programs from a Tcl script.  TclGempak
requires some of the modules of the Tcllib library. There are no other
requirements, and in particular it is a pure Tcl library so there is
nothing to compile.

Sources, documentation and binary packages for FreeBSD, CentOS and Debian,
in tbz, rpm and deb formats, respectively, are available from the software
section in

	http://www.noaaport.net

Since TclGempak is written entirely in Tcl, the packages can be
installed anywhere the same package management tools are used.

The distribution comes with a set of examples to illustrate the
basic functionality, and with a README file that list the available
procedures and their usage. The packages install the examples and README
under

	<PREFIX>/share/doc/tclgempak

where <PREFIX> is /usr (CentOS, Debian) or /usr/local (FreeBSD).
