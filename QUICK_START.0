QUICK_START.0

These notes cover the instructions that are common to all the operating
systems on which the program runs, and they are here for documentation
purposes only. 

The steps explained below for configuring nbsp are
carried out automatically by the system packages installation tools,
which are described in the individual QUICK_START.xxx files.

If nbsp is installed from the packages, no further instructions
beyond those given in the individual QUICK_START.xxx files
are required to run in the default configuration.

1) Installation  -

- The packages are installable with the native tools for
freebsd and linux. The package installs in /usr/local. The main program is
"/usr/local/sbin/nbspd", and apart from the other various binaries
and other files, it installs the directory

	/usr/local/etc/nbsp

that contains several configuration files that will be described below.

- To complete the installation the following is required:

 (i) create the directories

	/var/noaaport/nbsp/spool
	/var/noaaport/nbsp/db
	/var/noaaport/nbsp/stats
	/var/noaaport/nbsp/inv
	/var/noaaport/nbsp/dev
	/var/noaaport/nbsp/tmp
	/var/noaaport/data/{nbsp,gempak,digatmos}
	/var/log/noaaport

Actually only the first three are strictly required, but the others will
be required as well depending on which post-pocessors (filters)
are installed. 

The following are optional:

 (ii) cp nbspd.conf-sample nbspd.conf
       
   and edit as desired. If this file (nbspd.conf) does not exist
   the program will simply use the compiled in default values
   for various parameters (such as the directories mentioned above).

 (iii) For automatic start/stop at boot/shutdown time, a script
   must be installed in the rc.d or init.d directory. The particulars
   of this depends on the OS, and it is further explained in the
   individual QUIACK_START files.

At this point the program can be started and it should run.
It should start to receive files and storing them under 

	    /var/noaaport/nbsp/spool

at a rate of about a thousand per minute.

Without further configuration it will not do anything else. But if it fails
up to this point, then something is really wrong somewhere.

2) Configuration -

The configuration files live in

	/usr/local/etc/nbsp

The main configuration file is 

	nbspd.conf

which can be created by just copying the nbspd.conf-sample included.
While the other files there are also editable, they contain the marching
orders for the various filters and are not meant to be edited,
and there should be no need to edit them, under normal circumnstances. 

The default nbspd.conf file has all the settings commented out,
so it does nothing. It contains many comments indicating the use
of the various settings, which can be enabled by uncommenting the
appropriate lines. A better alternative to editing the nbspd.conf file
itself, is to create a separate file

	/usr/local/etc/nbsp/site/nbspd.conf

and add the settings there. This latter file is automatically included
(sourced) by nbspd.conf. The location of this local file can be changed
by modifying the last sentences of nbspd.conf. The language of the
configuration files is tcl.


3) Filters -

The most common configuration options are related to enabling the filters.
The appropiate settings are indicated in the nbspd.conf file. Besides
enabling them there an additional step is required. 

Each filter is typically supported by several files. For our
purposes now the important one is the run-control (rc) file. For
example, for the gempak filter it is gempak.rc, for the rstfilter
it is rstfilter.rc.  By default, the package installation does not
install any of them. So, for each filter that is enabled in nbspd.conf,
the corresponding rc file must created in the configuration directory.
The nbsp distribution contains a sample rc file for each of the filters,
so it is just a matter of copying them with the correct name. If a
filter is enabled in nbspd.conf, but its rc file does not exist,
the program will disable the filter when it runs.

In order for the filters to save the processed files the corresponding
data directories must exist. This has been taken care of, if
you have created the "/var/noaaport/data" directory (and the subdirectories)
indicated above. If the gempak filters are enabled, then the directory
"/var/log/noaaport" must exist also. 

4) Web Server

The built-in web server listens on port 8015 by default; i.e.,
in your web browser

	http://localhost:8015

or

	http://<yourmachine>:8015

The server is based on the tclhttpd library, and the the document
root is installed in /var/noaaport/www. 


5) Periodic routines

Spool directory -
The received files, stored in the spool directory, have a unique
tag (sequence number) in their name so that newer files
of any given product do not overwrite previous ones (within a long cycle).
Therefore, if the spool directory is not cleanup periodically it will
grow indefinitely. The nbsp package includes a sample script in the
documentation directory, that is meant to be installed as a cron job
to be run hourly for this purpose. The package installation may have
installed that already, depending on the operating system. 

Data files directories -
The various filters write their files in the corresponding data directories
and, without further intervention, they would grow without bounds. The
data directories must therefore be examined periodically to remove
older or obsolete files. The sample script mentioned above does this as well.

Log files directory -
In addition, some of the decoders write processing information to log
files that are stored in /var/log/noaaport, that must be rotated or
managed somehow. The documentation directory contains sample configuration
files that can be included in the newsyslog or logrotate schemes in place
in the host machine.

6) Pre-requistes -

The program is linked against the

	tcl, db

libraries, so they must be present in the system. In addition
the operation of the filters depend on various external programs.
In particular the following packages/libraries must be installed:

	db4, tcl, tcllib, png, zlib, netpbm, gnuplot

All the filters need tcl. The satellite decoder needs the png library,
and the emwin-compatible server needs the programs of the netpbm package
to convert the png images to jpg format. The nntp gateway and various tools
interface requires tcllib, and the ploting facility of the metar module
requires gnuplot.

The gempak filter requires the gempak decoder programs,
and they assume that gempak has been installed using the gpak package.
Otherwise the file filters.conf must be consulted to set the
correct location of the gempak decoders.
