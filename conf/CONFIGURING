- When installing from a binary package (rpm or tbz),
it will be configured with the

	inventory
	rstfilter
	dafilter
	metarfilter
	gribfilter
	http server

enabled. To run with these default settings, no further steps are needed.
To modify these, or to add other services (e.g., emwin server),
check first the file "features.conf". For more fine-grained configuration
and additional options check "nbspd.conf".

- In the default configuration as above, the satellite images
are produced without maps, and radar images are _not_ generated.
To produce either satellite images with maps, or radar images,
requires that gempak be installed, which can be done with the gpak
package.

If gempak is installed:

  - Consult the file "filters.conf" to set the apropriate location of gempak.
    (Not necessary if gempak was installed from the gpak package.)
  - Then look for the following variables in "rstfilter.conf" to
    produce satellite images with maps and radar images, respectively:

	rstfilter(satoptionmap)
	rstfilter(rad_enable)

  - In addition the gpfilter can be enabled in "features.conf"
    by setting the variable feature(gpfilter) in order to
    process the data files and save them in a gempak-compatible
    directory structure such that they can be used with the gempak programs.

To run nbsp together with ldm (for example to have ldm get some data
from another ldm server from the internet), see the ldmfilter.README file.

There are a few other README files in the "dist" subdirectory. That
subdirectory contains also the original copies of all the configuration
files as a backup.
