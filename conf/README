The directory

	/usr/local/etc/nbsp

contains the main configuration file "nbspd.conf" for the program,
the main configuration file for each of the filters, and other
files required files. After the program or a filter reads its
configuration file xxx.conf, they look for the files

	defaults/xxx.conf
	site/xxx.conf

and if they exist they will be read, in that order. Latter settings
override previous ones. 

Every nbsp package is distributed with an identical set of confguration
files. The purpose of the "defaults" subdirectory is to be able to distribute
nbsp packages pre-configured for a particular purpose. The corresponding
configuration files are placed in that subdirectory.

The "site" subdirectory is always distributed empty, and this is
where the configuration files that contain the local modifications
should be placed.

When installed from a package, the software is already configured to run
with some default features (e.g., rstfilter and dafilter).
The file "CONFIGURING" has some hints for modifying the default
configuration, and detailed explanations appear in the configuration
files themselves.

The subdirectory "dist" has the original copies of all the configuration
files as a backup.
