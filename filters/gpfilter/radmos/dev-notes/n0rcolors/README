With the information from the parent dir, "n0r.colors.txt" was
prepared, and processed with n0r.colors.awk to produce
n0r.colors.html. A screenshot of that page then produced n0r.colors.{png,gif}
which is the basis for the color legends used in the scripts, via gifsicle:

n0rmap="nexrad_mosaic.gif";
n0rlegend="n0r.colors.gif"
output="n0r.gif"
#
gifsicle $n0rmap $n0rlegend | gifsicle -U "#1" > $output  (man gifsicle)
