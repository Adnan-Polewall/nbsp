The nbsp2ldm program should be compiled and installed
(after compiling and installing ldm), by executing

# make LDMHOME=/home/ldm
# make LDMHOME=/home/ldm install

or substituting for /home/ldm the base directory of ldm (i.e., the parent
directory of the ldm include and lib subdirectories).

If the ldmpak package is installed, the appropriate commands are

# make LDMHOME=/usr/local/lib/ldm
# make LDMHOME=/usr/local/lib/ldm install
