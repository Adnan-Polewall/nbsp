1) The file "color_ramp.gif" comes from

	http://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/docs/nexrad_composites/

and it gives the "standard" color coding. Quoting from that site:

``The raster image has a colormap associated with it. The raw pixel
values increase monotonically from -30 dbz to 75 dbz every 5 dbz.
All values below 0 dbz are assigned black (rgb 0 0 0).
We have tried to match the commonly used NEXRAD display as what you
see on National Weather Service page. Please note: We do not include
a concept of missing data or "no-data". So spots with beem blockage
in the mountains or out away from the CONUS are just "black".''

2) The file "gempak_colors4.gif" comes from

	http://www.mesoscale.ws/gempak/

In gempak, the background color is 101. I remember that I saw this
somewhere in the gempak documentation or help files, but I don't
remember exactly where (it is also mentioned in msg01399.txt).

Therefore

1) in order to have a white background, the equivalent of this code
must be used (or setting some other color background)

gpcolor <<EOF1
DEVICE = gif|output.gif
COLORS = 101=255:255:255
r

e
EOF1


2) Looking at the nexrad color table, and identifying (by eye) the
corresponding index in thegempak table, then the folowing must be
given in the arguments to gdplot2:

background="101";
blue="27;26;25"
green="21;22;23"
yellow="19;18;17"
red="16;15;14;7;29"
white="31"
#
FINT = 0;5;10;15;20;25;30;35;40;45;50;55;60;65;70;75
FLINE = ${background};${background};${blue};${green};${yellow};${red};${white}
