# This file can be edited as explained below. However, instead of editing
# it directly, it is best to make a copy in "site/gpmap/sat/satmap.rc" and
# edit that copy.
#
# This is a tcl script that is "sourced" by the nbspsatmap tool that is
# executed by the rstfilter for each radar data file received.
# The filter defines the following variables that this script can use:
#
#	gpmap(fmt)		(gif)
# 	gpmap(outputfile)   	(default output file path name)
#	gpmap(devsize)		(default image size; e.g., "800;600")
#	gpmap(inputfile)	(full path of input file data file)
#	gpmap(wmoid)		(e.g., "tige01")
#
# This script can define additional gpmap() variables, and can redefine
# the gpmap(outputfile) and gpmap(devsize) variables,
# and at some point it must contain a portion of the form
#
#	set gpmap(script) {
#		<gpmap commands here>
#	}
#
# The commands can contain any of the gpmap() variables.
#
# The tool then feeds the gpmap(script) to gpmap by executing
#
# 	puts $F [subst $gpmap(script)]
#
# where F is a handle to gpmap; i.e.,
#
#	set F [open "|gpmap_gif <options>" w];
#
# The "subst" command substitutes the values for the tcl variables in the
# script before sending it to gpmap.
#
# Finally, the "gpmap" scripts can contain another "post" script definition
# of the form
#
# set gpmap(post) {
#  file copy $gpmap(outputfile) /var/www/html/images
# }
#
# Any valid tcl commands can appear in this portion.
# Such code will be executed (via eval) as tcl code, after
# closing the pipe to gpmap.
#
# In this example the final image file that gpmap produces is copied to the
# directory /var/www/html/images. Any valid tcl code can be included, and
# it can be used in particular for transfering the image files to
# other locations and web sites.
#
# Of course the above example is trivial, but a variation using, for example
# wget or more comprehensive tools like sitecopy, can be setup to transfer
# the file to a remote location.
