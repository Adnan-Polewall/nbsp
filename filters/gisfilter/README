1) In principle some of the functionality of this filter can be
implemented as part of the dafilter and/or rstfilter. But since WCT
is so slow processing the files, that is not prudent. By using
this filter separately, it can run even on a separate computer without
modifying the other filters.

2) I have not been able to use the nids file with wct-export. I keep
getting this error

0%java.lang.Exception: No Grids found in file.
Check CF-compliance for gridded data

despite the fact that I do
	(i) nbspunz on our nids files
	(ii) I strip the 4-byte gempak trailer from the file, so that
	it has the same length as the files from the ncdc.
	Apparently those files (ncdc) contain some additional (grid)
	information.
