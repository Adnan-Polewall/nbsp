To complete the configuration:

1) In the ".d" subdirectories copy (or symlink) the files from "dist"
   to "enable".

   NOTE: Only conus needs to be enabled in gisfilter-bundle.d/enable since
         that will pull all the states (and sites) for processing.

2) Edit

    bundle-plist.conf

to enable more products for each bundle.
