Instead of filling with comments the sample scripts, here are some
explanations of the most common or useful features.
-

GENERAL -

The scripts are based on the Tclgrads library.
When a tgs file is executed, the following variables are defined:

	gsplot(ctlfile)
	gsplot(ctlfname)
	gsplot(model)
	gsplot(grid)
	gsplot(reftime)
	gsplot(forecasttime)
	gsplot(imgfile)
	gsplot(outputdir)

Taking an example, these have the values

	/var/noaaport/data/grib/ctl/gfs/2009020918/gfs_213_2009020918_48h.ctl
	gfs_213_2009020918_48h.ctl
	2007090901
	gfs
	213
	48h
	
The imgfile and output are blank unless they are are specified in
the command line.

In addition, in the nbspgribsched.rc file there can appear additional
variables defined. For example,

lappend schedule "H:grads/gs/tmpprs.gs:gfs/gfs_211_*_6h:gfs:level=3

will define the variable

	gsplot(M,level)

with the value 3.

The script nbspgribplotc reads one of the ".gs" files in each directory,
by a executing the instruction

   source <gsfile>

The <gsfile> can contain additional tcl variable definitions, but
at some point it must contain a portion

::grads::init;
::grads::open $gsplot(ctlfile);

followed by commands similar to the following

::grads::exec set gxout shaded;
::grads::exec d prmslmsl;
::grads::exec set gxout contour;
::grads::exec d prmslmsl;
::grads::exec draw title <title>;
::grads::exec printim <outputfile>;

and ending with

::grads::end;
-

UPLOADING -

The scripts can contain addtional commands such as

  file copy $gsplot(outputdir)/prmslmsl-$gsplot(date)-$fcast.png \
	/home/www/images/model

Since the scrips is a regular tcl script, any valid tcl commands
can appear.
