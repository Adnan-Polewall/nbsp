UPGRADE NOTES -

1) Starting with version 2.0, Nbsp can be upgraded easily.
The first thing is to install the nbspadm package for your OS.
That package contains the program _nbspupdate_ which is used as follows.
Executing

	nbspupdate

without arguments, will check the version of the installed Nbsp package
against the latest one available, and if the latter is newer than the
former it will download it. The Nbsp package can then be upgraded
manually as usual. Alternatively, executing

	nbspupdate -u

will do the upgrade automatically after downloading the package as above.
By passing the [-F] option as well, i.e.,

	nbspupdate -u -F

nbspupdate will do as above, even if the installed version is the same
as the latest one, or if Nbsp had not been installed before.

Nbspupdate can be used if nbspd is running, by passing the [-r] option,
i.e.,

	nbspupdate -u -r

This will cause it to fetch the new package, stop the running daemon, upgrade
the package and restart the newly installed daemon.

nbspupdate can also upgrade Npemwin and Nbspadm itself,
by passing any of those names as an argument; i.e.,

	nbspupdate -u npemwin

will download and upgrade Npemwin if the latest version is different
than the installed one.

2) Starting with version 2.0.r2, nbspd runs as the user
"noaaport", and therefore the directories where the daemon writes
must be owned by that user:

    chown -R noaaport:noaaport /var/noaaport
    chown -R noaaport:noaaport /var/log/noaaport
    chown -R noaaport:noaaport /var/log/nbsp
    chown -R noaaport:noaaport /var/run/nbsp

During a fresh install, the package installer will create the
directories with the appropriate ownership, but not during an upgrade.
If you are uprading from an older version, those commands must be
executed manually.

3) When upgrading to a new version of nbsp, it may be necessary sometimes to
delete all the files in the directories

	/var/noaaport/nbsp/db
	/var/noaaport/nbsp/spool

This is not usually needed. It depends on whether nbsp is using a new version
of the Berkeley DB software and/or a different file format.
