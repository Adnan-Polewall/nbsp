UPGRADE NOTES -

1) Starting with this update (1.6.r7), the "hourly-cleanup.conf" uses
a slightly different syntax than before. If you have made modifications
to that file, be sure to incorporate them in the new version.

2) When upgrading to a new version of nbsp, it may be necessary sometimes to
delete all the files in the directories

	/var/noaaport/nbsp/db
	/var/noaaport/nbsp/spool

This is not usually needed. It depends on whether nbsp is using a new version
of the Berkeley DB software and/or a different file format.
