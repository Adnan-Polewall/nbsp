The configuration files are installed in

	/usr/local/etc/nbsp

The installation process should have created various directories
under /var/noaaport, and already enabled the rstfilter and dafilter.
In addition the web server is enabled by default, and can be
accesed as
	
	http://localhost:8015
or
	http://<hostname>:8015

The program will run in this default installation without further
configuration.
