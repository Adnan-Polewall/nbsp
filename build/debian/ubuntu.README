The debian package can be used in Ubuntu as well.

The tcllib-1.8 that is included in Ubuntu is not compatible
with nbsp. A compatible tcllib deb package will be available
in the optional-packages section (soon).

For the moment, create the directory /usr/local/share/tcltk
(if it does not exist) and then unpack file tcllib-1.11-share.tgz and move
the entire directory tcllib1.11 to /usr/local/share/tcltk.
For example,

	tar -xzf tcllib-1.11-share.tgz 	-C /usr/local/share/tcltk
