The tcllib-1.8 that is included in MacOSX is not compatible
with nbsp. A package for tcllib-1.10 is available
in the optional-packages section.

Some of the filters use the following external programs and/or libraries
that are not included in MaxOSX.:

	- gnuplot
	- netpbm
	- libpng

While the nbsp daemon will run without them, some functionality of the
filters will be missing. Packages of these for MacOSX are available
from the Fink Project site
