# This file can be used as the starting point to configure a
# master (ingest machine) with a memory-based spool.
#
# To enable the memory bdb based spool, set the variable
#
#	set feature(spooltype) 2
#
# in "features.conf", and
#
#	cp <this file> site/nbspd.conf
#       cp dist/netfilter-mspoolbdb.conf-ex site/netfilter.conf
#
# Then edit the mspoolbdb settings below, and then add any settings to
# this file as needed (for example, setting the interfaces, port
# numbers, and so on).

# The default parameters for the memeory bdb spool are:
#
# ndb = 4          (4 minutes)
# dbcache_mb = 50  (each one)
# nmax = 1500      (each one)
# nslots = 4       (buffer slots for reading)
# maxsize_per128 = 96 (maximum db size as a fraction of 128)
#
# These define 4 databases, with each database configured such
# that it can hold the files received in about one minute (50 MB).
# This requires 200 MB + 20% (overhead) of free memory, to hold a backlog
# of 4 minutes of data. The "Nslots = 4" parameter configure 4 reading buffers
# for retrieving the data from the db to send it to the nbs1 network clients.
# The Nslots parameter should be set to the maximum number of clients
# that can be expected. Note that each slot can take up to about 20 MB.
# Each db is not allowed to grow larger than (maxsize_per128/128) in order
# to reserve some of the allocated memory for the system. The default is
# 96/128 or 75%.
#
set mspoolbdb_dbcache_mb	50;
set mspoolbdb_ndb		4;
set mspoolbdb_nslots		4;
set mspoolbdb_maxsize_per128    96;

# These lines can be commented if desired to disable the inventory
# filter and the netfilter in the network sever. If the netfilter
# is enabled, be sure to put "set netfilter(dobody) 0" in netfilter.conf.
# (Copying netfilter-mspoolbdb.conf to site/netfilter.conf does that.)
