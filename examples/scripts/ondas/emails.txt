I'm CC'ing Tyler Allison on this reply since he maintains the spec on his
server.

The ONDAS spec is valid and is the protocol used in my GRLevel3 program.
Here are the answers to your specific questions:

1) GRLevel3 does not use config.cfg. It looks for grlevel3.cfg. 

2) I don't know if Digital Atmosphere follows the ONDAS spec or not. It
isn't a Gibson Ridge Software program.

3) Yes, there needs to be a file/script in each radar product subdirectory
that lists the files in that directory. GRLevel3 needs that in order to know
what is contained in the directory. The default is "dir.list". You can
change that name by putting a "ListFile: xxxxx" statement in your
grlevel3.cfg. GRLevel3 will append "xxxxx" to the product subdirectory in
the URL when making the directory listing URL. For example, "ListFile:
dir.php" would execute the dir.php script on your server to get a listing. 

4) I don't know what other programs are compatible with the ONDAS spec.


The ONDAS spec is designed to work with the standard directory structure
produced by an LDM feed.

Let me know if you have other questions or need clarification on any of the
answers.

Mike, Tim

I have some questions about the

  OPEN NEXRAD DATA ACCESS SPECIFICATION -- ONDAS/1.0-DRAFT

of which you are co-author. Of course the first one is whether that document
is still relevant, in the sense that it is supported by the various client
applications that you may be aware of.

But the specific questions are:

1) In the grlevel? programs, is that file recognized with the

   config.cfg

or does it have to be named something else?

2) Does "Digital Atmosphere" use that file?

3) As I understand, there has to be a  "dir.list" file in each data
subdirectory, listing the files in that subdirectory. 
It seems that there is no provision for it to point to a cgi script that
would compute that listing and return the result. Is this interpretation
correct, or is it possible to have the dir.list with a base url that is
different from the data subdirectory?

4) Is it known what client programs are compliant with that specification?

Thanks for your help

Jose F Nieves

Actually I believe GR3 looks for grlevel3.cfg first and then config.cfg if
it can't be found. This is a hold over from when Mike and I were working
on the spec and it was GR specific at the time.

It does. You would need to talk to Tim Vasquez for more details.

Folks running servers do one of two things.

1. They generate the dir.list file utilizing a script that generates the
file using the 'ls' command every time a new file comes down the LDM pipe
2. They utilize Apache's ReWrite construct to "catch" all requests for
dir.list and "rewrite" the url to a PHP script to generate the file
listing on the fly (this is what AllisonHouse does)
