- The file dualp.cfg was created in anticipation of the new
(dual polarization) radar files. The new product list was taken from the file
"newproducts-2010/radar.txt" in the dev-notes directory.

- The station list in grlevel.cfg was sorted.

- The file tdwr.cfg was created for the tdwr files in case those
types are used in the future. The list of tdwr stations was taken from
tdwr-radar-list.pdf in the dev-notes, and the types were extracted from
a live system from the sju site.

Original -

The functionality of producing the dir.list file has been
implemented directly in the filters (the dafilter) so that
the dir.list file is updated on-the-fly as a new product is
received. The mkdirlist script here is obsolete.

The configuration file grlevel3.cfg is a working example that
can be used in the nbsp distribution.
