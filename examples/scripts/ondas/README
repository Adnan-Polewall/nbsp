The functionality of producing the dir.list file has been
implemented directly in the filters (the dafilter) so that
the dir.list file is updated on-the-fly as a new product is
received. The mkdirlist script here is obsolete.

The configuration file grlevel3.cfg is a working example that
can be used in the nbsp distribution.
