                   OPEN NEXRAD DATA ACCESS SPECIFICATION

1. INTRODUCTION

   The objective of the Open Nexrad Data Access Specification (ONDAS)
   is to make raw NEXRAD data, and ancillary related data, available
   to clients in a structured manner, with minimal impact to the
   data server and in an efficient manner.

   ONDAS is independent of the particular transmission subsystem and
   requires only a reliable ordered data stream channel. Local file
   systems, HTTP or FTP could be used.


2. REQUIREMENTS

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and 
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   RFC 2119.

   An implementation is not compliant if it fails to satisfy one or
   more of the MUST or REQUIRED level requirements for the
   specification it implements. An implementation that satisfies all
   the MUST or REQUIRED level and all the SHOULD level requirements
   for its protocols is said to be "unconditionally compliant"; one
   that satisfies all the MUST level requirements but not all the
   SHOULD level requirements for its protocols is said to be
   "conditionally compliant".


3. SPECIFICATIONS 

3.1 Base URI
   
   ONDAS presumes a base URI on which to build the client data
   request. No particular base URI is required in the specification,
   but a few examples would be:

   http://www.webserver.com/data/nexrad/
   ftp://www.ftpserver.com/
   C:/Nexrad/Data/
   
   Clients are expected to already know the Base URI for the
   particular data service provider they intend to use.

3.2 Data Configuration File

3.2.1 Naming Convention

   Data providers MUST provide a config file upon request from a
   client. The config file MUST be named 'config.cfg' and be located
   at the base URI of the service.
   
   http://www.webserver.com/data/nexrad/config.cfg
   ftp://www.ftpserver.com/config.cfg
   C:/Nexrad/Data/config.cfg

   Clients MUST request the config.cfg file upon first contact with
   the data provider.

   Clients MAY request the config.cfg file at anytime.

3.2.2 Content

3.2.2.1 File Listing

   The configuration file MUST contain a ListFile directive that
   specifies what file contains a list of available data files. A
   new line starting with 'ListFile:' is used.

   The format MUST be:

   ListFile: ffffff

   ONDAS clients MUST default to a ListFile of 'dir.list' should no
   ListFile directive be found in the Data Configuration File.

3.2.2.2 Available Sites

   The configuration file MUST contain a Site directive that specifies
   which radar sites are available beneath the Base URI. A new line
   starting with 'Site:' specifies a single radar location.

   The format MUST be:

   Site: SSSS

   Data providers MUST use the four letter WMO format in all capitals.

   Site: KILN
   Site: KFWS
   
3.2.2.3 Available Products

3.2.2.3.1 Level II Data

   Level II NEXRAD data is not made available from the NWS in
   individual product files as is the case with Level III data.

   Level II data providers MUST store the data in a directory
   structure using the 4 letter WMO format and MUST be all capitals
   letters. [See LDM Configuration]

   Level II clients MAY ignore the Product directive and presume
   that all products for a particular site and for a particular time
   are contained within a single file within the site directory
   below the Base URI.

   A directory listing URI for the Level II data at site location
   KILN, from a server whos config.cfg file contains the
   following lines:

   ListFile: dir.list
   Site: KILN

   might be...

   http://www.webserver.com/data/nexrad/KILN/dir.list
   ftp://www.ftpserver.com/KILN/dir.list
   C:/Nexrad/Data/KILN/dir.list


3.2.2.3.2 Level III Data

   When providing Level III NEXRAD data the configuration file MUST
   contain a Product directive that specifies what products are
   available beneath the Base URI. A new line starting with 
   'Product:' specifies a single product.

   Each line MUST consist of the following:

   Product: TTT DDDDDD

   TTT is the three letter code for a product.
   DDDDDD is the directory in which the product can be found.

   Clients MUST search the DDDDDD portion of the product directive
   for literal 'SSSS', 'SSS', 'ssss', and 'sss'. If found the client
   MUST convert to upper or lower, and possibly trim, the requested
   site to the appropriate format. The remaining characters in the
   directory portion of the product directive MUST have their case
   preserved. For example:

   For 'Site: KILN'
   Product: GSM SSS/GSM  =  Product: GSM ILN/GSM 
   Product: GSM sss/GSM  =  Product: GSM iln/GSM
   Product: GSM ssss/gsm =  Product: GSM kiln/gsm

   A directory listing URI for the Level III GSM product at site
   location KILN, from a server whos config.cfg file contains the
   following lines:

   ListFile: dir.list
   Site: KILN
   Product: GSM sss/GSM

   might be...

   http://www.webserver.com/data/nexrad/iln/GSM/dir.list
   ftp://www.ftpserver.com/iln/GSM/dir.list
   C:/Nexrad/Data/iln/GSM/dir.list


3.3 NEXRAD Data Files

   All data providers MUST store files using the below specified
   format. 

   The first 8 contiguous digits are used for the data (yyyymmdd), an
   underscore, the next 4 contiguous digits are the time (hhmm) in 24
   hour notation. Date and time MUST be in GMT/UTC timezone.

   June 26, 2005 @ 11:45PM UTC would be 20050626_2145

3.3.1 Directory Listing

   Data providers MUST provide the client with a directory listing
   upon request. 

   Data providers MAY restrict how often a client may request a
   directory listing.

   Clients SHOULD NOT request a directory listing less than 60
   seconds from the previous directory listing.

   When producing a directory listing (default: dir.list) the files
   must be in date sorted order with the newest file at the bottom of
   the list. A directory listing might contain the following:

   20050626_2145
   20050626_2155
   20050626_2205
   20050626_2214
   20050626_2224
   20050626_2234
   20050626_2244
   20050626_2253
   20050626_2303

3.3.2 Level III Data Format

   All clients MUST support uncompressed and compressed file formats.

   All clients MUST be able to determine if they are dealing with a
   compressed file or an uncompressed file. The data provider is not
   required to identify the format.

   Data providers MAY provide either format.

3.3.2.1 Uncompressed

   All clients MUST support uncompressed data.

   Data providers MAY support uncompressed data.

   Uncompressed format is what is normally available on the public
   National Weather Service servers.

3.3.2.2 Compressed

   All clients MUST support compressed data.

   Data providers MAY support compressed data.

   Level III data is commonly compressed using the zlib compression
   algorithm when transmitted using the Unidata/LDM system. The files
   also contain a standard WMO CCB header.  Once the file has been
   decompressed and the header is stripped, the file will process
   exactly like the uncompressed format.

   Sample code is available upon request. (ucnids.c)

4. LDM Configuration

  LDM is a software package provided by Unidata and is commonly used
  to obtain meterological data.

4.1 Level II

  Your pqact.conf file would contain the following if you intended to
  make all radar data available via your service. The output directory
  is up to the administrator, however a suggestion is provided below.

  CRAFT   ^L2-BZIP2/(....)/([0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-1][0-9][0-3][0-9])(
[0-2][0-9][0 -5][0-9])([0-9][0-9])
        FILE    data/craft/\1/\1_\2_\3
 
4.2 Level III 

  Your pqact.conf file would contain the following if you intended to
  make all radar data available via your service. The output directory
  is up to the administrator, however a suggestion is provided below.

  NEXRAD  ^SDUS.. .... ([0-3][0-9])([0-2][0-9])([0-6][0-9]).*/p(...)(.
..)
        FILE    -close  data/nexrad/\5/\4/(\1:yyyy)(\1:mm)\1_\2\3
