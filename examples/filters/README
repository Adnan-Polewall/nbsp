The directories gpk-{file,pipe} are the original m4 implementations
of the gempak filters. The directory gempak-filter is a 
consolidation of both in one single filter.
The directory "pipe" contains
the m4 implementation for a general pipe tool.

Fpr some reason that I don't understand, the separate gempak-file
and gempak-pipe filters are more efficient  than the consolidated
filter gempak-filter.
