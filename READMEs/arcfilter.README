The arcfilter archives the files as they are saved in the spool
directory. Therefore by default those archives will contain the files
with the ccb header. To archive them without the ccb header
the following settings can be made:

In site/nbspd.conf

   set spoolsavefmt 1  
 
In site/filters.conf

   set common(ccbsaved) 0
   set filterslib(ccbsaved) 0
