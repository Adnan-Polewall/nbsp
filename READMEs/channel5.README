Nbsp can support two additional noaaport channels besides the
standard four, but they are not enabled by default. To enable,
for example, the 5th (polarsat) channel, the following line
must uncommented in "nbspd.conf" or put "site/nbspd.conf",

set multicastip	  "224.0.1.1 224.0.1.2 224.0.1.3 224.0.1.4 224.0.1.5"
set multicastport "1201 1202 1203 1204 1205"
