To use nbsp with inn (news server) -

1) Install nbsp as usual
2) Install inn.
3) Install the nbsp-news package.

That will enable the distribution of

	- text bulletins
	- images (radar and satellite)
	- text data files (e.g., metar reports and others)

No further steps are required.

The raw data files of the radar and satellite images can also be
distributed by setting

		set features(nntpfilter) 1

in the "features.conf" file.
