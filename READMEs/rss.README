The rss feeds are generated within the rstfilter and the relevant
settings apear in "rstfilter.conf". There is very little
to configure there except disabling the functionality.

The mechanism is based on a template system and the template
files are in the subdirectory "defaults/rss" in the main configuration
directory.
